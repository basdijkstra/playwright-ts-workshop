  // Login by:
  //   Typing 'john' into the username text field. You'll need an XPath or a CSS selector to locate the input element.
  //   Typing 'demo' into the password text field. The same as above applies here.
  //   Clicking the button with name 'Log In'. See the example for an idea on how to do this. You can use getByRole() here.


  // Check that the page contains an element with an 'id' attribute with value 'accountTable'.
  //   You'll again need an XPath or a CSS selector to do this.
